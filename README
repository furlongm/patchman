Patchman is a django-based patch status monitoring tool for linux systems.

Patchman clients send a list of installed packages and enabled repositories to
the patchman server. The patchman server (CLI or web) updates it's package list 
for each repository and tells the user which hosts require updates, whether
those updates are normal or security updates, and shows installed packages that
are not part of any repository. Hosts, packages, repositories and operating
systems can all be filtered (using features or arbitrary tags). For example, you
can find out which hosts have a certain version of a package installed, and
which repository it comes from.

Patchman does not (yet!) have the ability to update packages on hosts, although
it is possible to use a yum or apt plugin to send a report to the patchman
server every time changes are made to packages installed on a system. There are
plans for a module for patchman<->puppet integration to allow remote
installation of packages.

The current code is available on github:

On the clients, rpm based OS's can tell if a reboot is required to install a
new kernel by looking at uname -r and comparing it to the highest installed
kernel version. However debian-based OS's do not often change the kernel
version, so these clients will need update-notifier-common installed for this
functionality to work.

In terms of functionality of the web interface, most things are self-
explanatory, though two things might need further explaining.

An OSGroup differs from an OS, in that an OSGroup is a collection of OS's.
For example, a "Debian 6" OSGroup could be comprised of machines with the
following OS's -> "Debian 6.0.1", "Debian 6.0.2", "Debian squeeze/sid".
The OS names are obtained from the client hosts, so these may differ
depending on patch-level version, even though they are the same operating
system. Likewise, a "CentOS 5" OSGroup could cover "CentOS 5.4",
"CentOS 5.7", etc. Once OVAL support is added this will allow you to see
which CVE affects given machines in an OSGroup, as the CVE's will apply
to OSGroup. Repositories can be linked to an OSGroup, or to a host itself.

Repostiories and mirrors are a similar concept. Each repository URL is
counted as a separate mirror, unless the repositories are linked together.
For Red Hat based hosts, this occurs automatically. Currently, for Debian-
based hosts, you need to manually link which mirrors form each repository.
