Patchman is a django-based patch status monitoring tool for linux systems.

Patchman clients send a list of installed packages and enabled repositories to
the patchman server. The patchman server (CLI or web) updates it's package list 
for each repository and tells the user which hosts require updates, whether
those updates are normal or security updates, and shows installed packages that
are not part of any repository. Hosts, packages, repositories and operating
systems can all be filtered (using features or arbitrary tags). For example, you
can find out which hosts have a certain version of a package installed, and
which repository it comes from.

Patchman does not (yet!) have the ability to update packages on hosts, although
it is possible to use a yum or apt plugin to send a report to the patchman
server every time changes are made to packages installed on a system. There are
plans for a module for patchman<->puppet integration to allow remote
installation of packages.

The current code is available through gitorious:

The current dependencies are:

python-django-tagging
python-django-south
python-django-extensions
django-andsome
python-debian
python-rpm
python-progressbar
python-lxml
python-argparse

On the clients, rpm based OS's can tell if a reboot is required to install a
new kernel by looking at uname -r and comparing it to the highest installed
kernel version. However debian-based OS's do not often change the kernel
version, so these clients will need update-notifier-common installed for this
functionality to work.
