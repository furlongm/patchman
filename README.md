# Patchman


## Summary

Patchman is a Django-based patch status monitoring tool for linux systems.
Patchman provides a web interface for monitoring the package updates available
for linux hosts.

## How does Patchman work?

Patchman clients send a list of installed packages and enabled repositories to
the Patchman server. The Patchman server updates its package list for each
repository and determines which hosts require updates, and whether those updates
are normal or security updates. The web interface also gives information on
potential issues, such as installed packages that are not from any repository.

Hosts, packages, repositories and operating systems can all be filtered. For
example, it is possible to find out which hosts have a certain version of a
package installed, and which repository it comes from.

Patchman does not install update packages on hosts, it determines and displays
what updates are available for each host.

`yum`, `apt` and `zypper` plugins can send reports to the Patchman server every
time packages are installed or removed on a host.


## Installation

See [the installation guide](https://github.com/furlongm/patchman/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
for installation options.


## Usage

The web interface contains a dashboard with items that need attention, and
various pages to manipulate and view hosts, repositories and mirrors, packages,
operating system releases and variants, reports, errata and CVEs.

To populate the database, simply run the client on some hosts:

```shell
$ patchman-client -s http://patchman.example.com
```

This should provide some initial data to work with.

On the server, the `patchman` command line utility can be used to run certain
maintenance tasks, e.g. processing the reports sent from hosts, downloading
repository update information from the web. Run `patchman -h` for a rundown of
the usage:

```shell
$ sbin/patchman -h
usage: patchman [-h] [-f] [-q] [-r] [-R REPO] [-lr] [-lh] [-dh] [-u] [-A] [-shro | -uhro] [-sdns | -udns] [-H HOST] [-p] [-c] [-d] [-rd] [-n] [-a] [-D hostA hostB] [-e] [-E ERRATUM_TYPE] [-v] [--cve CVE] [--fetch-nist-data]

### Client dependencies

The client dependencies are kept to a minimum. `rpm` and `dpkg` are
required to report packages, `yum`, `dnf`, `zypper` and/or `apt` are required
to report repositories. These packages are normally installed by default on
most systems. `which`, `mktemp`, `flock` and `curl` are also required.

For Protocol 2 (JSON-based reports), `jq` is required. If `jq` is not available,
the client will automatically fall back to Protocol 1 (text-based reports).

deb-based OS's do not always change the kernel version when a kernel update is
installed, so the `update-notifier-common` package can optionally be installed
to enable this functionality. rpm-based OS's can tell if a reboot is required
to install a new kernel by looking at `uname -r` and comparing it to the
highest installed kernel version, so no extra packages are required on those
OS's.


## Concepts

The default settings will be fine for most people but depending on your setup,
there may be some initial work required to logically organise the data sent in
the host reports. The following explanations may help in this case.

There are a number of basic objects: Hosts, Repositories and Mirrors, Packages,
Operating Systems Releases and Variants, Reports and Errata.

### Host
A Host is a single host, e.g. test-host-01.example.com.

### Operating System Releases and Variants
A Host runs an Operating System Release, e.g. Rocky 10, Debian 13,
Ubuntu 24.04. The particular version running is called a Operating System
Variant. e.g. Debian 13.1, Ubuntu 24.04.4 and Variants are linked to a
Release. For some OS's like Arch Linux, there are no Variants.

### Package
A Package is a package that is either installed on a Host, or is available to
download from a Repository mirror, e.g. `strace-4.8-11.el10.x86_64`,
`grub2-tools-2.02-0.34.el10.rocky.x86_64`, etc.

### Mirror
A Mirror is a collection of Packages available on the web, e.g. a `yum` or
`apt` repo.

### Repository
A Repository is a collection of Mirrors. Typically all the Mirrors will contain
the same Packages. For Red Hat-based Hosts, Repositories automatically link
their Mirrors together. For Debian-based hosts, you may need to link all
Mirrors that form a Repository using the web interface. This may reduce the
time required to find updates. Repositories can be marked as being security or
non-security. This makes most sense with Debian and Ubuntu repositories where
security updates are delivered via security repositories. For rpm security
updates, see the Erratum section below.

Repositories can be associated with an OS Release, or with the Host itself. If
the `use_host_repos` variable is set to True for a Host, then updates are found
by looking only at the Repositories that belong to that Host. This is the
default behaviour.

If `use_host_repos` is set to False, the update-finding process looks at the
OS Release that the Hosts Operating System Variant is associated with, and
uses that Releases Repositories to determine the applicable updates. This is
useful in environments where many hosts are homogeneous.

### Report
Hosts create Reports using `patchman-client`. This Report is sent to the
Patchman server. The Report contains the Hosts running kernel, Operating System,
installed Packages and enabled Repositories. The Patchman server processes the
Report records the information contained therein.

### Erratum
Errata for many OS's can downloaded by the patchman server. These Errata are
parsed and stored in the database. If a PackageUpdate contains a package that
is a security update in an Erratum, then that update is marked as being a
security update. CVE and CVSS data is used to complement this information.
